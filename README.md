A side project that I completed on 10 Dec 2017 or thereabouts. It is basically a custom [Kustom Live Wallpaper Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper) theme that I made for my phone homescreen, that as you can see, is fully interactive and conveniently shows me a lot of the information that I frequently need. Inspired by the [Westworld TV series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/) which features great-looking futuristic UIs on tech gadgets used by the characters.

The folder organization here is clearly a mess, and includes a lot of random and irrelevant files. I like to look back on this project every once in a while and see how far I've grown.
